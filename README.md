------

## Privacy Statement 
- Alto values your privacy and is committed to being transparent about how your data is handled: 

##### Location Data
- The location you input - be it an address, zip code, or city - is locally stored to your *own* computer and is **temporarily** sent to the Census Geocoder to 'translate' your location into longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, the format required by the National Weather Service (NWS) API. Alto **does not** store this information anywhere outside of your local machine.
    - For more details on how the Census Geocoder may handle your data, please review their [privacy policy](https://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy.html)
    - For more details on how the NWS may handle your data, please review their [privacy policy](https://www.weather.gov/privacy/).
- To assist with zip code -> coordinate conversion, Alto uses [zippopotam.us](https://www.zippopotam.us)

##### Local Storage and Opt-Out
- For usability purposes, your locally stored location will automatically be used as the query location upon opening Alto.
- If you prefer not to store your location locally, you may opt-out through the `options` tab. Please note this will require you to input a location each time you use Alto.
